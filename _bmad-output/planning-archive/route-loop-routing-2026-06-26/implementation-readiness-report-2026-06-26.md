## PRD Analysis

### Functional Requirements

FR-1: Workflow authors can declare a `route_loop` node with its own `id`, `depends_on`, `from`, `condition`, optional `max_iterations`, and required `routes`.
The node must parse as a first-class DAG node, remain distinct from existing AI `loop`, own route outcomes, avoid adding `routes` to regular nodes, and have no nested body or subgraph.

FR-2: The system rejects any node that combines `route_loop` with executable modes, conditional node gating, or trigger-rule gating.
A Route Loop node cannot declare `prompt`, `command`, `bash`, `script`, `approval`, `cancel`, existing `loop`, `when`, or `trigger_rule`.
Existing nodes without `route_loop` and existing AI `loop` behavior must remain unchanged.

FR-3: The system requires `route_loop.from` to be present, requires `depends_on` to contain exactly one entry, and requires that entry to equal `route_loop.from`.
The From Node must not be optional through `when`.
If the From Node is skipped, failed, pending, missing, or has no usable output when the Route Loop evaluates, the Route Loop must fail fast.
Multiple gate outputs require an explicit aggregation node before `route_loop.from`.

FR-4: The system requires `route_loop.routes.positive`, `route_loop.routes.negative`, and `route_loop.routes.exhausted`.
Each target must be a short string node ID referencing a real node.
No route can target the same Route Loop node.
No terminal sentinel such as `__end__` exists in v1.
Each outcome points to exactly one node ID, and different outcomes may share a target when route-cycle and rerun-path validation pass.

FR-5: The system supports `route_loop.max_iterations` as the count of allowed Negative Outcomes for that Route Loop.
If omitted, it defaults to `10`.
If provided, it must be an integer from `1` through `100`.
It counts Negative Outcomes, not total route decisions.
False results 1 through `max_iterations` select Negative Outcome, and the next false result selects Exhausted Outcome.

FR-6: The system evaluates `route_loop.condition` with the existing condition grammar used by `when`.
Conditions support existing comparison and compound expression forms.
They do not add route-loop-specific parentheses, functions, string normalization, expression rewriting, or a scoped `$output` alias.

FR-7: The system requires every node reference inside `route_loop.condition` to reference the From Node.
This applies to compound expressions, canonical `$node.output.field` references, and shorthand `$node.field` references.
Runtime fail-fast remains required as a secondary guard.

FR-8: Workflow authors can compare the whole text output of the From Node without declaring `output_format`.
Whole-output references use existing output string behavior and require no route-specific parsing.

FR-9: Workflow authors can reference structured output fields from the From Node only when those fields are declared in the From Node's `output_format.properties`.
Undeclared, missing, or unresolvable referenced fields fail.
The Route Loop must not treat output-reference errors as Negative Outcome.

FR-10: The system fails the Route Loop when `route_loop.condition` cannot be parsed.
Route Loop parse errors do not skip like regular `when` parse errors, do not select Negative Outcome, and do not burn negative route budget.

FR-11: Workflows that do not contain `route_loop` continue to parse, schedule, execute, summarize, resume, and validate with existing DAG behavior.
Existing workflow files require no migration.
Existing `loop`, `depends_on`, `when`, `trigger_rule`, retry, resume, approval, cancel, and artifact behavior remains backward compatible.

FR-12: Workflows that contain `route_loop` require nodes to be activated before dependency readiness can cause execution.
Root nodes with no dependencies are activated at startup.
A Route Loop activates the selected route target.
Normal `depends_on` readiness carries execution forward from the activated target.
The engine must not secretly rerun a nested body or implicitly jump from a fix node back to the From Node.

FR-13: The runtime selects `positive`, `negative`, or `exhausted` from the evaluated condition and the Route Loop's negative budget.
True conditions select Positive Outcome regardless of current Negative Count.
Positive resets only that Route Loop node's active counter after route metadata is recorded.
False conditions increment Negative Count first, then select Exhausted when the new count exceeds `max_iterations` or Negative when it does not.
Exhausted is completed control flow, not a node failure.
The selected route updates workflow run metadata before downstream activation and emits `node_routed` audit evidence.

FR-14: When a route activates a node that has already completed, the runtime runs that node again as a new one-based Attempt.
The latest completed Attempt becomes the source for `$node.output`.
Earlier Attempts remain available for audit and debug.
Main run summaries show only the latest Attempt per node, while detailed Attempt history remains in the event log.
Events record both per-node Attempt and global execution sequence.

FR-15: If a route tries to activate a node that is already running or paused, the workflow fails fast.
The runtime avoids concurrent Attempts of the same node, identifies the Route Loop and target node, and does not mutate counters or outputs in a way that hides unsafe activation.

FR-16: When a Negative Outcome is intended to retry and the Negative Route Target reaches the From Node, the runtime reruns only the dependency path needed to get from the Negative Route Target back to the From Node and then the Route Loop.
A negative path may exit without warning.
A retry target after the Route Loop in dependency order is unsupported in v1.
The runtime must not rerun every descendant of the Negative Route Target.
Multiple dependency paths back to the From Node are allowed.
Nodes inside the selected Rerun Path must not depend on nodes outside that path.
Rerun path self-containment is validated in the loader and at runtime.

FR-17: The system allows runtime cycles only when formed by a Route Loop route edge plus normal dependency edges guarded by that Route Loop's `max_iterations`.
The `depends_on` graph remains acyclic.
Runtime cycles must return to the same From Node of the same Route Loop.
Only Negative Outcome may participate in the loop cycle.
Positive Outcome and Exhausted Outcome must be exit paths and must not route back to the From Node, same Route Loop, or Negative Rerun Path.
Direct negative route to the From Node is allowed but should warn.
Nested Route Loops are allowed as independent nodes with independent routes and counters.

FR-18: The system persists Route Loop counters and attempt counters in workflow run metadata for the active workflow run.
Negative counters are keyed by Route Loop node ID and scoped by workflow run ID plus Route Loop node ID.
Starting a new workflow run resets counters by new run scope.
Normal resume and retry do not reset a Route Loop counter.
Internal storage may preserve `loopCounters`.
Route output and event metadata use snake_case fields.

FR-19: Resume preserves activation state, Negative Count, Attempt counters, and latest effective outputs.
Pause is a valid runtime state, not a workflow restart.
Resume continues from the paused node through the same route flow.
Resume cannot create a fresh negative budget for the same Route Loop inside the same workflow run.
Resume cannot mark unselected branches as skipped merely because they exist.

FR-20: When `retry-node` is used on a node inside a Route Loop, the retried node's new result continues through the route flow.
Users retry the From Node when they need a fresh route decision.
The Route Loop controller itself is not directly retryable because it can duplicate route side effects or increment counters without new source output.
Retry invalidation uses route-aware selected path semantics rather than all static descendants.

FR-21: Cancel, abandon, and resume keep existing Archon lifecycle semantics.
Route Loop does not introduce a new lifecycle status.
Cancel, abandon, and resume continue through existing behavior.

FR-22: Route-triggered reruns use existing node provider session behavior.
Reruns use fresh context only when node configuration requests fresh context.
Persisted provider sessions follow existing persist-session constraints.
Route Loop itself does not invoke a provider and does not create a provider session.

FR-23: The runtime emits a `node_routed` event for every Route Loop decision.
Event outcome names are exactly `positive`, `negative`, and `exhausted`.
Event metadata includes Route Loop node ID, From Node ID, selected outcome, target node ID, condition expression, boolean `condition_result`, `negative_count`, `max_iterations`, Attempt, and execution sequence.
For Positive Outcome, `negative_count` records the count before reset.
For Exhausted Outcome, `condition_result` remains `false`.
If the required route audit event cannot be recorded, the route decision fails before activating its selected target.

FR-24: `route_loop.output` mirrors the core route metadata from the `node_routed` event and does not copy the From Node output.
The output includes `outcome`, `to`, `condition`, `condition_result`, `negative_count`, and `max_iterations`.
Route Loop node ID and From Node ID are required in `node_routed` event metadata but are not required fields in `route_loop.output` for v1.
Route output metadata uses snake_case and does not include full attempt history.

FR-25: The main run summary shows only the latest Attempt for each node and excludes never-activated route targets from executed-node summaries.
Unselected Route Targets are not marked skipped and are not shown as executed nodes.
Graph UI shows never-activated route-capable nodes as `not_activated`.
API and Web projections distinguish `not_activated` from `pending` and `skipped`.
Attempt history remains available through event detail.

FR-26: Route decisions are persisted through required control state and required audit evidence so resume, retry projection, Web UI projection, and post-run debugging can reconstruct route behavior.
Route state can be reconstructed after process restart.
Route decisions are not visible only in transient logs.
Workflow execution control does not depend on best-effort event insertion succeeding.
Route counters, activation state, attempt counters, latest route output metadata, and `node_routed` persistence are required.
A route decision cannot silently continue after required route audit evidence fails to persist.
The event projection can distinguish route-triggered reruns from ordinary retry-node invalidation.

FR-27: The production Web workflow builder renders `route_loop` as a branch controller with one input and three labeled output ports.
Output ports are labeled `positive`, `negative`, and `exhausted`.
Route Loop nodes are visually distinct from existing AI `loop` nodes.
Any builder surface that can save or run workflows must either fully round-trip Route Loop or block unsupported editing without dropping fields.

FR-28: Edges from Route Loop output ports serialize directly into `route_loop.routes` string targets.
The `positive`, `negative`, and `exhausted` ports write their matching route keys.
No separate edge metadata is required in v1.

FR-29: The builder enforces exactly one input edge for a Route Loop and keeps that edge synchronized with both `depends_on` and `route_loop.from`.
Connecting or changing the input edge updates both fields together.
The builder prevents a second input edge.

FR-30: The builder marks a Route Loop invalid and blocks saving or running when any required route is missing.
Missing Positive, Negative, or Exhausted Outcome targets block save and run.
Different outcomes may target the same node.
There is no special validation ban on Negative Outcome and Exhausted Outcome sharing a target.

Total FRs: 30.

### Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1: Existing workflows that do not use `route_loop` must continue to load, execute, summarize, resume, retry, validate, and render as they do today.

NFR-2: The existing AI `loop` node contract must remain unchanged.

NFR-3: Existing `when` behavior must remain unchanged, including fail-closed skip behavior for unparseable `when` expressions.

NFR-4: No migration is required for current workflow files.

NFR-5: Runtime cycles must be bounded by the owning Route Loop's `max_iterations`.

NFR-6: The engine must fail fast on ambiguous route state, unsafe target activation, invalid rerun path containment, skipped or failed From Node state, and condition evaluation errors.

NFR-7: The engine must not silently choose Negative Outcome when it cannot confidently evaluate the condition.

NFR-8: The engine must not infer a route target from naming conventions, graph shape, or prompt content.

NFR-9: Every route decision must be inspectable after the fact.

NFR-10: Event history must preserve older Attempts and chronological route decisions.

NFR-11: The main run summary must remain compact enough for normal run review.

NFR-12: Route output metadata must be structured, stable, and usable by downstream nodes.

NFR-13: Route metadata fields must use snake_case.

NFR-14: Engine schema changes must flow through server OpenAPI schema generation and web generated types.

NFR-15: Web builder validation must not drift from engine validation for route-loop-specific invariants.

NFR-16: Route expression validation should reuse or mirror the engine's allowed node-reference grammar.

NFR-17: Builder UI must not silently drop unsupported Route Loop fields during round trip.

NFR-18: The default negative route budget is `10`.

NFR-19: The maximum configured negative route budget is `100`.

NFR-20: The runtime must avoid rerunning unrelated descendants outside the selected Rerun Path.

NFR-21: Selected-path recomputation should be linear in node plus edge count for the current workflow graph.

NFR-22: Route Loop should not introduce a global emergency execution cap in v1.

Total NFRs: 22.

### Additional Requirements

- Public route surface names are fixed as `route_loop`, `positive`, `negative`, and `exhausted`.
- Route target values must be real short string node IDs.
- Route Loop owns `routes`; regular nodes do not gain `routes` in v1.
- No public `routes.default` exists in v1.
- `depends_on` remains acyclic.
- Runtime cycles are allowed only through Route Loop route edges.
- Positive Outcome and Exhausted Outcome are exit paths.
- Negative Outcome is the only route allowed to participate in a loop back to the From Node.
- Rerun path self-containment is validated statically and at runtime.
- Nodes inside a Rerun Path cannot depend on nodes outside that path in v1.
- Canonical condition syntax is existing `$node.output` or `$node.output.field`.
- Older examples using `$output` are rejected.
- Canonical event and output metadata naming is snake_case.
- Older examples using `negativeCount` or `maxIterations` are rejected.
- Route Loop node ID and From Node ID are required in `node_routed` event metadata and are not required fields in `route_loop.output`.
- MVP scope includes schema, loader validation, route-aware runtime, state preservation, required route metadata, main summary behavior, production Web builder round trip, secondary builder compatibility, and focused tests.
- MVP excludes arbitrary cyclic graph execution, route fanout, route-only analytics beyond events and graph state, historical Attempt expression access, automatic prompt augmentation, per-route custom retry budgets, new condition functions, migration tooling, and global graph caps.
- Addendum brownfield notes require route-loop schema support, loader validation, route-aware executor path, existing no-route executor preservation, `node_routed`, resume and retry projection changes, selected-path invalidation, OpenAPI and generated Web types, Web builder support, Web event bridge support, docs, and `not_activated` projection.
- Suggested validation focus includes schema rejection, max-iteration default and bounds, missing and invalid route target cases, direct negative-to-From warning, positive and negative and exhausted runtime selection, route condition errors, selected path reruns, latest output semantics, resume preservation, retry-node continuation, direct controller retry blocking, persisted and live route events, builder route validation, and builder route round trip.

### PRD Completeness Assessment

The PRD is comprehensive and materially implementation-ready.
It defines a clear product goal, target users, user journeys, glossary, 30 functional requirements, cross-cutting NFRs, public constraints, non-goals, MVP scope, success metrics, risks, and brownfield handoff notes.
The addendum reconciles earlier source conflicts around `$output`, snake_case metadata, output field shape, route audit durability, and builder surface priority.
The PRD itself still lists three open questions, but the selected architecture and epic artifacts later settle those decisions.

### Missing Requirements

No missing PRD Functional Requirements were found.
No Functional Requirements were found in the epics document that do not map to PRD FR-1 through FR-30.

### Coverage Statistics

- Total PRD FRs: 30.
- FRs covered in epics: 30.
- Coverage percentage: 100 percent.

## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status

UX documentation is present.
The selected UX documents are `DESIGN.md` and `EXPERIENCE.md`.
The builder mockup exists as supporting evidence at `mockups/route-loop-builder.html`.

### UX To PRD Alignment

The UX documents align with the PRD user journeys.
PRD UJ-3 maps to the builder canvas, node library, Route Loop inspector, validation panel, and YAML split view in the UX spine.
PRD UJ-1 and UJ-2 map to the workflow run detail graph, event and logs panel, route decision rows, attempt history, and `not_activated` state in the UX spine.
The PRD builder requirements FR-27 through FR-30 are represented directly in UX component rules and state patterns.
The PRD observability requirements FR-23 through FR-26 are represented in the run detail graph, logs, route decision row, and runtime observability contract.
The PRD lifecycle requirements FR-19 through FR-21 are represented in retry action panel and resume state rules.

### UX To Architecture Alignment

The architecture supports the UX requirements through AD-10, AD-12, and AD-13.
AD-10 defines `not_activated` as REST and Web projection state, matching the UX requirement that unselected route targets must not appear as skipped or executed.
AD-12 requires the production builder to support one input port and three named output ports and requires secondary save or run surfaces to round-trip or block Route Loop, matching the UX authoring contract.
AD-13 defines a dedicated `workflow_route` SSE payload, supporting live route-decision display in the run detail graph and logs.
The implementation plan carries UX-relevant work into Phase 4 for API, SSE, and run detail projection, Phase 5 for production builder, and Phase 6 for secondary builder guard.
The epics and stories include explicit acceptance criteria for route labels, keyboard and assistive technology behavior, responsive route outcome availability, inspector synchronization, validation focus, selected route edge display, route decision rows, and public microcopy terms.

### Alignment Issues

No critical UX, PRD, and Architecture misalignment was found.

### Warnings

- The HTML mockup covers the production builder surface but does not mock run detail graph, event and logs panel, retry action panel, or secondary builder surfaces.
- Those surfaces are specified in `EXPERIENCE.md`, architecture, and story acceptance criteria, so this is not a blocking gap.
- Implementation should still verify those spine-only surfaces with focused tests and visual review because they carry important observability and recovery UX.

## Epic Quality Review

### Overall Assessment

The epic structure is generally strong and follows the create-epics-and-stories standards.
The four epics are organized around user value rather than pure technical layers.
The sequence is coherent for a brownfield feature.
Epic 1 enables safe authoring and validation.
Epic 2 delivers bounded execution.
Epic 3 delivers recovery and run review.
Epic 4 delivers visual authoring.

### User Value Focus Check

Epic 1, Safe Route Loop Workflow Definition, delivers workflow-author value by making `route_loop` declarable and safely validated before runtime.
It is not merely schema setup because it gives authors a usable contract and clear validation behavior.

Epic 2, Bounded Route Loop Execution, delivers workflow-runner value by making quality gate routing actually execute with bounded retry behavior and durable route evidence.
It is not merely executor refactoring because it enables the core BMAD review loop outcome.

Epic 3, Route-Aware Recovery And Run Review, delivers operator and reviewer value by preserving route flow across resume and retry and making run state understandable.
It is independently meaningful after Epic 2 because it improves recovery and observability rather than making the core route decision function.

Epic 4, Visual Route Loop Authoring, delivers authoring value by allowing users to create, validate, save, and run Route Loops in the production Web builder without losing route fields.
It is distinct from Epic 1 because it addresses the Web authoring workflow rather than the YAML and loader contract.

### Epic Independence Validation

Epic 1 stands alone as a complete authoring and validation contract.
Epic 2 can function using Epic 1 output because valid `route_loop` workflow definitions can execute without needing Epic 3 run-review enhancements.
Epic 3 can function using Epic 1 and Epic 2 outputs because it relies on route state and events that Epic 2 provides.
Epic 4 can function using earlier schema and runtime contracts because it creates and preserves route definitions for execution.
No epic requires a future epic to work.

### Story Sizing And Dependency Review

No story has an explicit forward dependency on a later story.
Story sequencing is coherent within each epic.
Story 1.1 establishes the controller node contract before source, route, and condition validation stories.
Story 2.1 establishes activation before outcome selection, rerun behavior, and persistence semantics.
Story 3.1 through Story 3.4 progress from resume to retry to lifecycle to run-state projection.
Story 4.1 through Story 4.4 progress from rendering to synchronization to validation to round-trip safety.

### Acceptance Criteria Review

Acceptance criteria use Given, When, and Then structure consistently.
Criteria are mostly independently testable.
Error and boundary cases are represented across schema validation, condition failures, route counters, unsafe targets, rerun path containment, route audit persistence failure, retry blocking, `not_activated` projection, save and run blocking, keyboard accessibility, responsive behavior, and secondary builder safety.
Story-level requirement traceability is present through `Requirements covered` lines.

### Database And Entity Creation Timing

No story creates all database tables or entities upfront.
The architecture explicitly defers dedicated route-loop DB tables and uses workflow run metadata plus workflow events for v1.
Story 2.4 introduces the route-decision persistence path only when route decisions need durable state and audit evidence.
This matches the brownfield requirement to modify only what the feature needs.

### Starter Template And Brownfield Check

No starter template requirement is present in the architecture.
This is a brownfield feature in an existing Archon monorepo.
The stories correctly focus on integration points with existing workflow schemas, loader validation, executor behavior, store contracts, server projections, generated Web API types, and builder surfaces.

### Critical Violations

None found.

### Major Issues

MI-1: Story 4.4 may be too broad for one dev session if implemented literally.
It covers production builder round-trip, undo and redo and layout and YAML split behavior, generated API type round trip, secondary builder handling, and OpenAPI type consumption.
This is coherent as a user outcome, but it crosses enough files and surfaces that sprint planning should split it into smaller implementation tasks or separate stories if the dev-agent context becomes large.
Recommendation: during sprint planning, either split Story 4.4 into production-builder round-trip and secondary-builder guard tasks, or keep the story but create explicit sub-tasks with disjoint file ownership.

### Minor Concerns

MC-1: Story 1.2 and Story 2.3 both touch route-cycle safety.
This is acceptable because Story 1.2 covers loader and static validation while Story 2.3 covers runtime revalidation.
Recommendation: preserve that split in implementation tasks to avoid mixing static graph validation with scheduler behavior.

MC-2: Story 3.4 and Story 2.4 both touch route events.
This is acceptable because Story 2.4 owns durable event writing and Story 3.4 owns projection and review UX.
Recommendation: keep store and projection responsibilities separate during sprint planning.

## Summary And Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

READY for sprint planning, with one major implementation-planning action.
The artifacts are not ready for blind story execution without addressing Story 4.4 sizing during sprint planning.

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

None.

### Major Issues Requiring Attention

MI-1: Story 4.4 is too broad if assigned as one unscoped dev session.
It combines production builder round-trip behavior, undo and redo and layout and YAML split behavior, generated API type round trip, secondary builder handling, and OpenAPI type consumption.
This does not invalidate the epic structure, but it does require sprint planning to split implementation tasks or create smaller execution stories.

### Warnings And Minor Concerns

W-1: Several UX surfaces are spine-only rather than mocked.
Run detail graph, event and logs panel, retry action panel, and secondary builder behavior must receive focused implementation tests and visual review.

MC-1: Static and runtime route-cycle safety are intentionally split between Story 1.2 and Story 2.3.
Sprint planning should preserve that boundary so loader validation and scheduler behavior do not blur.

MC-2: Durable route event writing and route event projection are intentionally split between Story 2.4 and Story 3.4.
Sprint planning should keep store transaction work separate from server and Web projection work.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Run sprint planning next.
   Use sprint planning to convert Story 4.4 into smaller implementation tasks or split it into production-builder round-trip and secondary-builder guard work.

2. Preserve architectural boundaries during sprint planning.
   Keep `@archon/workflows` schema, validation, and scheduler work separate from `@archon/core` store transactions, `@archon/server` projections, and `@archon/web` builder and run-detail work.

3. Carry the UX spine-only warning into the implementation plan.
   Require focused tests and visual review for route decision rows, selected route edge, `not_activated`, retry action copy, and secondary builder guard behavior.

4. Use the architecture implementation plan as the build order.
   The plan's six phases align well with the epic sequence and reduce risk by landing schema and loader validation before route-aware execution and UI work.

5. Keep route-decision durability non-negotiable.
   The strict `recordRouteDecision` path is the highest-risk implementation point because it bridges scheduler state, route output, and required audit evidence.

### Final Note

This assessment identified 1 major issue, 1 UX implementation warning, and 2 minor concerns across epic quality and UX coverage.
No critical blockers were found.
The artifacts are sufficient to move into sprint planning, provided Story 4.4 is split or tightly task-scoped before development execution.
